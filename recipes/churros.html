    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Cinnamon</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Procedure</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil water, sugar, salt, and vegetable oil. Remove from the heat, then stir in flour.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a pastry bag and pipe into strips.</li>
                <li>Fry the strips in hot oil until they're golden.</li>
                <li>Drain the churros, then roll in cinnamon-sugar.</li>
